My passions lie in software, user experience design, and app & web development. My personal projects and work experiences all display an intersection between computer science and UX, each with a heavy focus on solving real-life problems with screen-based solutions, ranging from mobile applications to chatbots. You can learn more about the different technologies I have designed and created on my "Portfolio" page.

I have also been doing academic research with CMU's HCII for over a year, advised by Yasmine Kotturi and Chinmay Kulkarni. Our research is focused on improving feedback exchanges in communities of small business owners and independent creators and designers.

In addition, I also have extensive experience in mentorship, having TA'ed for a number of semesters combined for 15-112 (Fundamentals of Programming & CS) and 18-100 (Introduction to Electrical & Computer Engineering) at Carnegie Mellon. 

Working together with others is a great joy of mine, and I seek to learn as much as I can from those I have collaborated with and mentored throughout the years.
