My interest lies in software, user experience design, and app & web development. 

I also have extensive experience in mentorship, having TA'ed for a number of semesters combined for 15-112 (Fundamentals of Programming & CS) and 18-100 (Introduction to Electrical & Computer Engineering) at Carnegie Mellon. 

Below, you can find a gallery of a number projects I have worked on that harnesses a mixture of computer science and design.
