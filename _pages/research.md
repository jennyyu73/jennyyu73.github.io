I am currently advised by the Human-Computer Interaction Institute's PhD student Yasmine Kotturi and Professor Chinmay Kulkarni. We are working in collaboration with Instagram to investigate how best to support small business owners and independent creators. 

More specifically, we are interested in supporting early-stage feedback for the in-progress work that designers and business owners produce.  

In an effort to encourage more quality feedback exchanges and to investigate the obstacles that designers face in their creative processes, we have created and iterated on a mobile application called Peerdea. It is available for both iOS and Android and has been deployed for 8+ months to Test Flight and is pending deployment to the Android Play Store. 

We are working in collaboration with a local Pittsburgh incubator program, [Prototype](https://prototypepgh.com/), the members of which consist the majority of Peerdea's current live users. Based on the feedback and suggestions of these users, we work to update Peerdea to best fit the needs of these creators and small business owners. 

Our team is currently working on submitting a paper to the Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) in October. 

Below is a detailed video created by myself showcasing different use cases and features of Peerdea.
